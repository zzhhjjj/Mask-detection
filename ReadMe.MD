# Mask detection and distance estimation project
## Our project has three parts.
### First part
The first part is to fine tune DenseNet 201 model on the dataset in order to distinguish between photos with masks and photos without masks. So it's run on Kaggle.

### Second part 
The second part is run on jupyter notebook. It takes an video and output the annotated video. In order to do so, we need the model trained on the first part. The parameters that need to be adjusted are putted at the beginning. For a video of 3 seconds, it could take one minute to run. I have putted a demo to demonstrate our work.
### Third part
And the last part of this jupyter notebook is independent from the previous codes, it implements an adhoc mask detection run on PC.
